# Automated_ML_Regression_Analysis
Check out this [page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/omshapira/Automated_ML_Regression_Analysis/blob/master/Regression_Analysis.html) for a demonstration of how to automate regression analysis and visualizations on any dataset using object-oriented programming techniques.

This was all demonstrated using a dataset for King's County housing prices. My exploratory data analysis (EDA) and scrubbing on this data can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/omshapira/Automated_ML_Regression_Analysis/blob/master/Housing_Data_EDA.html)

Enjoy!
