# Automated Machine Learning Regression Analysis and Optimization
Tired of always coding regression models from scratch for different datasets? Yeah...me too.

In this **[page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/omshapira/Automated_ML_Regression_Analysis/blob/master/Regression_Analysis.html)**, I demonstrate a Python Jupyter notebook shell that uses Object-Oriented programming techniques to automate analysis and performance optimization for various Machine Learning regression algorithms. It can be run on any ‘scrubbed’ dataset with categorical or numeric features, and it provides detailed regression metric comparisons and visualizations for each tested algorithm. The algorithms tested here were linear/polynomial regression, random forests, gradient-boosting, and kNN, but it's pretty simple to implement new algorithms with the same coding structure.

This was all demonstrated using a dataset for King's County housing prices. My exploratory data analysis (EDA) and scrubbing on this data can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/omshapira/Automated_ML_Regression_Analysis/blob/master/Housing_Data_EDA.html)

Enjoy!
